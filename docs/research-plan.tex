\section*{Background of the research}

% intro - what is prisoner's dilemma
How can we encourage and sustain cooperation? Humans dominate their environments thanks to our ability to cooperate flexibly and at scale, according to \citet{harari-sapiens}.
To study the conditions necessary for cooperation to flourish we will need a suitable model of an activity with temptations to defect and punishment for doing so.

In 1950, Albert Tucker named a particular two-player exchange game "The Prisoner's dilemma" \citep{sep-prisoner-dilemma}.
This game elegantly captures the difficulty of the decision between cooperation and defection in a single choice.
Despite being so simple compared to the complexity of the problem it is representing, it was used to model many different aspects of behaviour in systems of selfish individuals; and shown that cooperation is the optimal strategy in a wide variety of conditions.

% iterated version + the dilemma
In the case of a one-off exchange, when there is no opportunity for the opponent to punish us, the rational behaviour is defection. (This extends inductively to all rounds of a fixed-length game.)
The truly interesting behaviour arises when there is no end; or, at least, if there is no way for the participants of the game to know when or even if there is an end.
% reputation importance
One has to expect that even a single defection can be infinitely punished by never again cooperating with the culprit \citationneeded{GRIM}.
Such a risk may just not be worth it.

% global reputation system
Defection can, of course, only be punished if the culprit can be identified and known to others. This is why services like Ebay or Airbnb have a rating system in place.
Presence of a reputation system has been shown to strongly boost cooperation, as shown by \citet{simple-reputation} and \citet{public-private-monitoring}.
These studies used groups of volunteers as game participants and explored the effects of various information being public - from only the latest action of current opponent, to full histories of everyone.

% decentralizing reputation: keeping track internally?
Some limitations of these studies were the fact that they used humans as game participants and were thus limited to relatively small groups with relatively few rounds; they also used external infrastructure for information passing: eliminating noise, delays, and deliberately wrong information.
Using external infrastructure for passing information also meant that the transmission speed was uniform with all participants receiving all necessary information in time for their next round of the game.
These are non-negligible idealizations. Their relaxation would yield a model closer to real-world systems and could change the results drastically.
There is no way to tell without testing it out.



\section*{Research Question}
% Now state explicitly the main question you aim to answer or the hypothesis you aim to test.
% Argue why this is a reasonable hypothesis to test.
% Make references to the items listed in the reference section that back up your arguments.
Can we sustain cooperation with only local reputation?
Presence of a global reputation system fosters cooperation well, but has problems of its own and as a centralized system is vulnerable to censorship and malfunction can be very costly.
% Explain what you expect will be accomplished by undertaking this particular project.
By decentralizing the reputation system, we can leverage the participants themselves to create conditions ideal for cooperation while avoiding many shortcoming of the centralized system. \citationneeded{decentralized advantages}

% Break down the main question(s) into sub-questions that enable you to tackle your research in a more step-by-step manner.
% Aim to formulate (sub-)questions that are sufficiently concrete, such that other students would be able to answer them with a single experiment or proof, and that you would be able to judge whether they have done well.
% E.g.\ it is better to say: "under which conditions (e.g.\ problem size) is method A better than method B?" than "How can you do better than method B?". Include objective criteria for success. E.g.\ ``lower runtime than algorithm A'', ``better quality than method B'' or ``using fewer data samples than C'', etc. Try to envision how you would present the ideal outcome. E.g.\ a plot with the criterium on the $y$-axis.
Can we sustain cooperation with only local reputation?
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Can we replicate the design and results of \citet{smaldino}?
  \item How can we extend the model with variable-length memory and what strategies can we define on this new model?
  \item What is the best way to combine own observations and gossip from peers? We want to combine the data in such a way that we keep information about participants we are most likely to interact with in the next round.
  \item Does freely gossiping with other participants boost cooperation, when compared to no-gossip run?
  \item What is the difference between gossip-then-play, and play-then-gossip models? Does it make a difference if we gossip ex-ante or ex-post?
  \item Can we maintain this cooperation level by only gossiping compressed categorical data? (e.g. "hostile"/"neutral"/"friendly" instead of "defected in 82\% of rounds when unprovoked") So as to model the way natural language works and how local context skews the absolute meaning of words: "hostile" for one participant could be "friendly" for another.
